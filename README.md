# ParameterViewer
This is a project I am working on to learn a bit about web applications in general, and AngularJS specifically.

It will be a simple parameter viewer that shows the output of some time oriented process (sensor data output for instance).

The idea is that the user will also be able to provide some input by annotating the graphs.

The data will be retrieved from a backend using a REST interface.

I am only doing some testing with recent versions of Chrome.
